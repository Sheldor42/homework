\section{Problem}
Suppose the coupon rate for a level coupon bond is the same as the market rate. Show that this bond will be sold at par.
\subsection{Abstract}
A coupon bond issued to an investor typically yields a semi annular payment according to the face value, which does not change over time, and the annular interest rate. Thereby the issuer pays the investor the same amount each time a payment is due, until maturity is reached. \\
Thereby the yield can be calculated by:
\begin{equation}
G=\sum_{i=1}^{N} FV* YI
\end{equation}
where $FV$ stands for Face Value, $N$ is the amount of years, $G$ is the yield and $YI$ is the yearly interest rate.\\
Then the coupon rate $C$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
C=\frac{G}{FV}=N* YI
\end{equation}
Now assuming $C$ equals the market rate $k$, the real value of the bond $R$ can be calculated by:
\begin{align}
    R=C*FV&&R=k*FV \label{1}
\end{align}
now as $C=k$, \ref{1} implies $C*FV=k*FV$, thus the bond is sold at par, as the yield equals its coupon.
